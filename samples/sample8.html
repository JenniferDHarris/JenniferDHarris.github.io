    <p>Our class today focused on Pastor Josh's sermon on "Justice and Mercy" and we discussed the Pharisees' test to Jesus concerning the woman caught in adultery (John 8:1-11).
    </p>  
<p>The Pharisees were consumed with external religious practices, they had no relationship with God, no love or affection for people, and enforced a culture of condemnation. When they tested Jesus concerning the adulterous woman, Jesus never denied the woman had sinned, but told her that He did not condemn her and instructed her to leave her life of sin. Jesus brings with Him a new culture, one that encourages forgiveness and compassion. 
     </p> 
<p>1 John 1:9 says, "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness."
</p><p>Psalm 103:11-12 says, "For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him; as far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us." 
      
    </p>
         <p>We will all make mistakes, and we will all make bad choices in our lives, but I'm encouraged and feel so fortunate that our God continually extends His grace to us and is willing to forgive us.
</p>
   <p> "...for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus." (Romans 3:23-24)
