    <p>Today in class we reviewed Pastor Josh's sermon on The Upper Room. Pastor Josh focused on John 18:1-27 which recounts Jesus's arrest and questioning by the Jewish authorities. 
</p>
    
    <p>Jesus was calm despite the circumstances. He demonstrated control and authority, even in the face of opposition. Peter was in a state of fear and panic. He denied knowing Jesus three times, just as Jesus had said he would. Jesus is "I AM"; Peter is "I am not". Yet, despite Peter's shortcomings, he is considered one of Jesus's most prominent and influential disciples. Peter went on to play a significant role in the early church. This teaches us that our life is about dependency, not performance. I think Charles Stanley said it best - "Christ in us assumes the responsibility for the performance of everything He requires of us." Let's not let past failures get in the way of our current relationship with Jesus.

    <p>"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come; The old has gone, the new is here!" 2 Corinthians 5:17</p>
