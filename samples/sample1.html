    <p>Today in class we discussed Dr. Steve Gaines' sermon titled "When God Comes to Church" which focused on Acts 2:40-47.
    These passages describe the early Christain community that formed after the apostle Peter's sermon on the day of Pentecost.</p>
  <p>This fellowship of believers consistently gathered to learn from the apostles, spend time together, share meals, and pray.</p> 

<p>They looked out for each other, even selling their belongings to make sure no one went without. They met daily, at the temple and in their homes, worshiping God with joy. And the miracles the apostles did left everyone in awe.</p>

<p>The way these people lived - together, devoted, and active - set the example for how the church should be today.</p>
