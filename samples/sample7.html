    <p>We spent some time in class today discussing Pastor Josh's sermon on "True Disciples". We talked about “the truth” and how when you know the truth, it will set you free (John 8:32). 
    </p> 
     <p>I am studying the Old Testament and I wanted to see the different ways “truth” was used there. After a quick Google search, I found out that the Hebrew word for truth is found 127 times in the Old Testament! 
     </p> 
    <p>One example is in Deuteronomy when Moses was reciting the words of a song about God to the Israelites as he was preparing them to enter the land God had promised them. 
      
    </p>
    <p>"He is the Rock, his work is perfect; For all his ways are judgment: A God of truth and without iniquity. Just and right is he." Deuteronomy 32:4 
</p>
<p>God has always been associated with truth and when Jesus comes to earth, He proclaims, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life” (John 14:6).” 
</p>
    <p>Today, we have the awesome privilege of knowing Jesus, the actual incarnation of the truth! As Pastor Josh said last week, abiding in the word; having a relational closeness with Jesus; and continually moving toward Jesus and away from sin is what will truly set us free.
