    <p>Today in class we discussed Jace's sermon from October 20. Jace taught us about Jesus being the "living stone", "cornerstone", and "the stone the builders rejected". 
</p>
  <p>Even though Jesus was rejected by the Jewish leaders, he would become the cornerstone - the stone that is crucial for stability, alignment, and structural soundness on which our faith is built. We (acting as subsequent stones) are accurately positioned only after being anchored to Christ.  Isn't it absolutely humbling to think God has specifically chosen each and every one of us to be placed here? We are to build our lives on the living cornerstone, Jesus Christ, and actively take part in God's redeeming plan for all of creation! Amazing. </p>
