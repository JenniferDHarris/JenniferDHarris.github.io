    <p>Today we reviewed David Shivar's sermon titled "The Joy of Forgiveness".</p>
    <p>King David expresses in Psalm 32 that happiness is not something to be sought; happiness is a byproduct of knowing God, which comes through the forgiveness of sins.</p>
  <p>David sought God, embraced the gospel, and found true joy in trusting and following the Lord.</p>
<ul><li>Forgiveness is transferring your demands for justice to God for him to execute justice in his time and way. </li>
<li>Forgive others as God forgave you. We have been forgiven for infinitely more than we will ever be called to forgive others for. </li>
<li>Forgiveness is not optional for Christians; it is a direct command to reflect God’s love and mercy toward others. "... as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive." (Colossians 3:13b)</li>
</ul>
    <p>Isn't it reassuring that when we come to God and confess our sins, He will delight to forgive us?</p>
