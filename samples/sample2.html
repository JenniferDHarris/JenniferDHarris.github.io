    <p>Today we reviewed David Shivar's sermon on "The Joy of Forgiveness"</p>
    <p>King David expresses in Psalm 32 that happiness is not something to be sought, happienss is a byproduct of knowing God which comes through the forgiveness of sins.</p>
  <p>David sought God, embraced the gospel, and found true joy in trusting and following the Lord.</p>
  <p>Isn't it reassuring that when we come to God and confess our sins, He will delight to forgive us?</p>
