    <p>In class today, we reviewed Pastor Josh's sermon titled "The Glory of Christ's Shame". Pastor Josh focused on John 19:1-16. It’s an extremely hard portion of the Bible to read, recounting Jesus’s flogging, humiliation, and condemnation to crucifixion.  
</p>
    
    <p>You know - it’s easy to see Jesus’ glory shining bright when we read about Jesus changing water into wine in John 2, Jesus’ interaction with a Samaritan women in John 4, and Jesus’ healing of an invalid man at the pool in John 5, but where is the glory in Jesus’ horrible suffering? Isaiah 53:3-5 can help us. It reads:  
</p>
    <p>“He was despised and rejected by mankind, a man of suffering, and familiar with pain. Like one from whom people hide their faces he was despised, and we held him in low esteem. Surely he took up our pain and bore our suffering, yet we considered him punished by God, stricken by him, and afflicted. But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds, we are healed.”</p>
  <p>The glory in what happened to Jesus is that it was all for us. He took the punishment for all the wrongs we did. It was our rebellion that he died for. He was taking the punishment that we deserved. We can find glory in Christ’s suffering by seeing it as the ultimate display of God's love, grace, and justice. We are all sinners and are saved not by anything we have done, but only through what Christ did for us. </p>
