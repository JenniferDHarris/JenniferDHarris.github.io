    <p>Today in class we discussed Pastor Josh's sermon on "Cleansing Love". Isn't it amazing that the one who knows us best is the one who loves us most? And not only that. He loves us to the end! (John 13:1) Jesus' love for others was demonstrated all throughout his earthly ministry, and, of course, culminated with his selfless sacrifice on the cross.  
</p>
  <p>I don't know about you, but Josh's sermon today on one example of Jesus' sacrificial love - washing his disciples' feet - was truly eye-opening for me. I always knew that this act displayed Jesus' humility, foreshadowed his ultimate act of love on the cross, and gave the disciples an example to follow (John 13:15), but I never thought of it as Jesus' way to illustrate a daily, life-long need for spiritual cleansing! "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness." (1 John 1:9)  </p>
  <p>GotQuestions.org provides a great summary for us - "We need periodical cleansing from the effects of living in the flesh in a sin-cursed world. This is sanctification, done by the power of the Holy Spirit who lives within us, through the "washing of water by the Word" (Ephesians 5:26), given to equip us for every good work (2 Timothy 3:16-17)." https://www.gotquestions.org/Jesus-washing-feet.html</p>
